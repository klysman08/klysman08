Graduating in Production Engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais. I'm currently a member of the Smart Sense laboratory of the Computer Science department and of the Bioengineering laboratory (Labbio) of the Mechanical Engineering department, where I do research in the Computer Vision area. I'm a volunteer monitor in the open Idea Real laboratory, whose environment is provided with technologies and resources to encourage the development of projects and research in Synthetic Biology and Engineering. I also work as a developer at KRM Digital, a company that provides data analytics and digital marketing services.
